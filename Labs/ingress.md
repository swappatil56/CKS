In Namespace team-pink there is an existing Nginx Ingress resources named secure which accepts two paths /app and /api which point to different ClusterIP Services.

From your main terminal you can connect to it using for example:

HTTP: curl -v http://secure-ingress.test:31080/app
HTTPS: curl -kv https://secure-ingress.test:31443/app
Right now it uses a default generated TLS certificate by the Nginx Ingress Controller.

You're asked to instead use the key and certificate provided at /opt/course/15/tls.key and /opt/course/15/tls.crt. As it's a self-signed certificate you need to use curl -k when connecting to it.
